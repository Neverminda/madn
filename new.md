- ~~Add template parameter for the game-class for different player strategies~~
- ~~Vector in the GameRunner class is not optimal → only players using the same strategy can be added to it, defeats the

- ~~Change the implementation of the player from multi-threading to coroutine~~
- ~~Use await to wait for the dice rolling form the main-game-loop~~ (not needed)
- ~~Add Coroutine for a Player-Strategy that always draws another pawn each turn (cycles through all pawns)~~

# Lecture 09.12.2025
- Make the program run headless and optimize for the benchmark (time for 10.000 runs)
